# HackYourLearning
My open source book dealing with strategies and techniques to make learning anything to happen quicker.

I intend to write this short book about how to learn things faster, and to apply your learning in practical situations.

( Current Status: Writing the preface )

This book is at the very beginning phase, and I am open to contributions from other folks, just open an issue, discussing your methods of learning.
